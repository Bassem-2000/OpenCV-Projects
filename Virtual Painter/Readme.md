## Introduction

This Python project is an interactive drawing application that uses hand gestures to create drawings on the screen. It leverages the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and OpenCV for image processing. With this application, you can draw various shapes, change colors, and even use an eraser.

## Features

- **Hand gesture recognition:** The application tracks your hand's movement and detects gestures.
- **Drawing functionality:** You can draw lines, rectangles, and circles on the screen.
- **Color selection:** Change the drawing color by positioning your hand in specific regions.
- **Eraser tool:** Erase parts of your drawing using an eraser tool.
- **Easy switch:** Quickly switch between drawing tools and the eraser using hand gestures.
- **User-friendly interface:** The interface includes icons for color selection and tool switching.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the project:

- `numpy`
- `mediapipe`
- `opencv-python`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy mediapipe opencv-python
```
## Usage

1. Run the Python script.
2. The application will start using your computer's webcam.
3. Position your hand within the camera's view.
4. Use the following gestures to interact with the application:
    - **Two-finger pinch:** Activate drawing mode.
    - **Two-finger pinch and release:** Switch to eraser mode.
    - **Single finger move:** Draw lines or shapes (depending on the selected tool).
    - **Hand in colored regions:** Change the drawing color (black, red, blue, green).
    - **Hand in the "circle" region:** Select the circle drawing tool.
    - **Hand in the "rectangle" region:** Select the rectangle drawing tool.
    - **Hand in the "eraser" region:** Select the eraser tool.
5. Start drawing or erasing on the canvas.

## Additional Notes

- The drawing canvas is a white screen by default.
- You can switch between the pen, rectangle, and circle drawing tools using hand gestures.
- To erase parts of the drawing, select the eraser tool and move your hand over the area you want to erase.
- Press the 'q' key to exit the application.
